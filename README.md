Doomed to fail? Describing the extent of species reintroductions that have succumbed to negative
climate change

This project aims to improve our understanding of the impacts of recent climate change on species
reintroductions, and positively influence the current and future management of thousands of threatened
species globally.

Reintroductions of threatened species are perceived as a positive step towards addressing the global
extinction crisis; many hundreds of species have undergone conservation translocation and the successful
restoration of a species is a source of good news when many conservation narratives are profoundly negative.
However, it is well-established that reintroductions often fail with confirmed successes barely accounting for
half of all attempts. Failed reintroductions waste resources and stall recovery programmes, undermine
conservation action in the eyes of the public and policymakers, and might harm individual plants and animals,
in extreme cases further endangering the species. Whilst progress has been made in identifying factors that
promote reintroduction success, there is one fundamental component of species survival that has until recently
been overlooked with respect to explaining reintroduction outcomes – that of the climate niche of the focal
species and the potential for variation of climate suitability between release sites.

Reintroductions implicitly assume that a species’ current range is a reliable proxy for its ecological niche and
that climatic conditions at release sites are suitable. However, climate suitability varies within a species’ range
just as factors such as competition or food availability vary. But whilst practitioners often cite poor weather or
climate as contributing to reintroduction failure, there are few examples of attempts to identify climatically
optimal sites before going ahead with a release. Recent work by myself and co-authors at LJMU and the
Center for Plant Conservation, USA, has linked poor climate suitability to reintroduction failure in insects,
amphibians and reptiles by using species distribution models to derive climate suitability metrics at release
sites. We demonstrated that climate variations within the current range of a species can be crucial in
determining the likelihood of population survival post-release.

With this proposal, I intend to build on our previous findings that focussed on current climate, by determining
the additional impact of climate change between the recent past (1970-2000) and near future (2021-2040) on
reintroduction success. I aim to demonstrate that the direction and magnitude of climate change will interact
with climate suitability at the point of release to influence the outcome of the reintroduction. Ensemble
computer models will be built with species-specific climate variables and project climate suitability for 120-150
threatened plants and be used to derive change in climate suitability from the recent past to near future climate
experienced by every released population. In some cases, reintroduction will have taken place in suitable
climate conditions, but a subsequent deterioration will have rendered the release sites unsuitable. In other
cases, climate change may actually be positive so climatic improvement might promote the survival of
reintroduced populations. Either way, the possible effect of climate change on reintroductions is crucial to
understand, and this work has the potential to provide evidence of the impacts of recent climate change and
inform threatened species management.
